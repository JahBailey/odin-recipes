    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone knows what pizza is!</p>
        <p>But I'm tired so I'll be using frozen dough.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pack Frozen Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>16oz Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>2 TSP Dried Herbs (Oregano and Parsley)</li>
        <li>3 TBSP Flour</li>
        <li>1 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>8oz Mozzarella, Shredded</li>
        <li>2/3  Cup Toppings (Choose your own!)</li>
        <li>2 TBSP Basil, Chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Let dough rise. Keeping the store bought dough in the bag, set it out on a counter for 30 minutes up a few hours. When you’re ready to make the pizza, preheat oven to 450 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Stretch the dough. Place raw pre-made dough dough on top of flour, coating each side. Begin stretching the dough by pinching the outside in a circular motion to spread it out. Then you can alternate between pinching the dough with your fingers, pressing it out on your work surface, and using your knuckles to pull the dough from underneath in an outward motion. Usually a few motions work best! When it’s large enough, transfer it to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and a light drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake the naked pizza dough in the oven at 450 for 7 minutes. During this time, prep toppings. </li>
        <li>Once dough is cooks for 7 minutes, take it out and preheat the oven to 500. Brush olive oil around the perimeter of the dough to create a golden crust. Add the sauce, any dried herbs, cheese and other toppings. Sprinkle the crust with parmesan and a light sprinkle of salt. Add pizza sauce, dried herbs, cheese and other toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza at 500 for 7-10 minutes, removing when the cheese has melted. Sprinkle chopped basil and allow the pizza to cool a few minutes before slicing and serving. </li>
    </ol>
